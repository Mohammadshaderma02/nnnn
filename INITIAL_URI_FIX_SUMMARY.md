# Initial URI Reset Fix - Quick Summary üéØ

## Problem
When you navigate back from the FTTH/GSM screen and return to it, the `initialUri` from a previous Sanad callback was being processed again, causing unwanted behavior.

## Root Cause
The `getInitialUri()` function returns the URI that **launched the app** and this persists throughout the entire app session. It doesn't automatically clear after being processed.

## Solution
Added a **static variable** to track the last processed initial URI:

```dart
class _NationalityListState extends State<NationalityList> {
  static String _lastProcessedInitialUri = '';
  // ...
}
```

The deep link listener now compares the current initial URI with the last processed one:
- If **different** ‚Üí Process it
- If **same** ‚Üí Skip it (already processed)

## Files Changed
1. `lib/Views/HomeScreens/Subdealer/Menu/PostPaid/FTTH/NationalityList.dart`
   - Line 57-59: Added static variable
   - Lines 372-410: Updated `_initDeepLinkListener()`

2. `lib/Views/HomeScreens/Subdealer/Menu/PostPaid/GSM/GSM_NationalityList.dart`
   - Line 64-66: Added static variable
   - Lines 341-376: Updated `_initDeepLinkListener()`

## How to Test
1. Open FTTH ‚Üí Enter national number ‚Üí Sanad fails
2. Press back button
3. Return to FTTH screen
4. **Expected:** Clean screen, no automatic processing
5. **Console:** "‚è≠Ô∏è  Skipping initial URI - already processed"

## Why Static Variable?
- **Instance variables** reset every time the widget is recreated (when navigating back/forward)
- **Static variables** persist across all widget instances in the app session
- Perfect for tracking state that should survive widget rebuilds

## Impact
‚úÖ No duplicate processing of deep links  
‚úÖ Clean navigation experience  
‚úÖ Both FTTH and GSM screens fixed  
‚úÖ Stream URIs (new deep links) still work normally  

## Status
‚úÖ **COMPLETE** - Ready for testing
