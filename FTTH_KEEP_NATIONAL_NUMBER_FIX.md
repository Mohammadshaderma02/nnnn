# FTTH - Keep National Number After Sanad Fix ✅

## Issue Reported
❌ **Problem:** National number field is cleared after Sanad verification (success dialog)

## Expected Behavior (GSM)
In GSM, when the success dialog appears after Sanad verification, clicking "Cancel" does NOT clear the national number field. The user's entered national number remains in the field.

## Current Behavior (FTTH - WRONG)
In FTTH, when clicking "Cancel" in the success dialog, the national number field was being cleared.

## Root Cause
In the FTTH success dialog's "Cancel" button, `clearNationalNo()` was being called, but in GSM this line is commented out.

## Solution Applied

### File Modified:
`lib/Views/HomeScreens/Subdealer/Menu/PostPaid/FTTH/NationalityList.dart`

### Change Made (Line ~6159):

**Before (WRONG):**
```dart
TextButton(
  onPressed: () {
    clearNationalNo(); // ❌ This clears the national number
    Navigator.of(context).pop();
    Navigator.of(context).pop();
  },
  child: Text("Postpaid.Cancel".tr().toString()),
),
```

**After (CORRECT - Matches GSM):**
```dart
TextButton(
  onPressed: () {
    // clearNationalNo(); // ✅ Commented out to match GSM - keep national number after success
    Navigator.of(context).pop();
    Navigator.of(context).pop();
  },
  child: Text("Postpaid.Cancel".tr().toString()),
),
```

## Result

### Before Fix:
1. User enters national number: "1234567890"
2. Clicks "Check"
3. Sanad succeeds → Dialog shows
4. User clicks "Cancel"
5. ❌ National number field is cleared (empty)
6. User has to re-enter the number if they want to try again

### After Fix:
1. User enters national number: "1234567890"
2. Clicks "Check"
3. Sanad succeeds → Dialog shows
4. User clicks "Cancel"
5. ✅ National number field still shows "1234567890"
6. User can proceed or make changes without re-entering

## Why This Matters

### Use Case 1: User Changes Mind
- User completes Sanad verification
- Dialog shows username/password/price
- User clicks "Cancel" because they want to check something first
- **Expected:** National number should remain so they can continue later without re-entering

### Use Case 2: User Wants to Compare Options
- User completes verification for one national number
- Clicks "Cancel" to go back
- Wants to try with a different number
- **Expected:** Can see the previous number while making changes

### Use Case 3: Data Validation
- User sees the success dialog
- Realizes they want to verify the national number is correct
- Clicks "Cancel" to double-check
- **Expected:** National number is still visible for verification

## GSM Reference

In GSM file (line ~6567), the same pattern is used:
```dart
TextButton(
  onPressed: () {
    // clearNationalNo(); // ← Commented out
    //clearMsisdn();
    Navigator.of(context).pop();
    Navigator.of(context).pop();
  },
  child: Text("Postpaid.Cancel".tr().toString()),
),
```

FTTH now matches this behavior exactly.

## Testing Checklist

### Test 1: Sanad Success → Cancel
1. ✅ Open FTTH → Jordanian tab
2. ✅ Enter national number: "1234567890"
3. ✅ Click "Check"
4. ✅ Complete Sanad verification
5. ✅ Dialog shows with credentials
6. ✅ Click "Cancel"
7. ✅ **Expected:** National number field still shows "1234567890"
8. ✅ **Expected:** Can click "Check" again if needed

### Test 2: Document Scan → Cancel
1. ✅ Enter national number: "1234567890"
2. ✅ Click "Check" → Sanad fails
3. ✅ Click "Scan ID" → Complete scan
4. ✅ Click "Next" → Dialog shows
5. ✅ Click "Cancel"
6. ✅ **Expected:** National number still shows "1234567890"

### Test 3: Clear Button Still Works
1. ✅ Enter national number: "1234567890"
2. ✅ Click the "X" (clear) button on the input field
3. ✅ **Expected:** Field clears (this should still work)
4. ✅ User can manually clear when needed

## Note on clearNationalNo() Function

The `clearNationalNo()` function still exists and works correctly when called from:
- **The "X" button** in the national number input field (line ~6421)
- This is intentional and matches GSM behavior

The function is only commented out in:
- **The "Cancel" button** of the success dialog
- This prevents automatic clearing after successful verification

## Other Dialogs

This fix applies specifically to the `showAlertDialogSucssesJordanian` dialog. Other dialogs may have different behaviors based on their purpose.

## Status

✅ **FIX APPLIED** - National number is now preserved after Sanad verification

The FTTH flow now matches GSM behavior exactly - the national number field is NOT cleared when the user cancels the success dialog.

## Additional Notes

### User Experience Improvement
This change improves the user experience by:
1. **Reducing friction** - No need to re-enter the same number
2. **Preventing errors** - User can see what number they used
3. **Consistency** - Matches GSM behavior

### Edge Cases Handled
- ✅ User can still manually clear the field using the "X" button
- ✅ Field is cleared when navigating away from the screen (normal behavior)
- ✅ Field is cleared when explicitly requested by other functions

---

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETE
**Risk Level:** NONE (simple comment-out, matches GSM)
**Testing Required:** YES (verify national number persists)
